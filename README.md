# 42 - Fract'ol

Fract'ol is a graphical project to explore mathematical fractals like Mandelbrot, Julia, and Burning Ship, using MiniLibX for rendering. Designed for 42 students to enhance algorithmic and graphic programming skills.

## Need to Optimize

Implemented a direct redraw mechanism for the fractal during zoom operations to minimize memory usage and improve performance, avoiding the storage of unnecessary image states.
